# Dynamic Form
This project was made by Dran Benedicto for testing purposes. This project is not in any way commercial, nor is open for the wide-public.

## üîß Setup Guide
Nothing special. Just clone the repo, use the .env (not the one on GitHub üòâ), and just npm start it.

## ‚ùì FAQs
Below are some frequently-asked-questions in regards of the production, and to the whole project itself.

## What framework did you use?
React Native.

## Any state management frameworks?
Nope. As much as I am fascinated in working with Redux, this project is a bit "too-small" for it. Sure it would still be useful, but it would just be an overkill I guess.

## CSS framework?
I used Material UI. I should mention that this is the VERY FIRST TIME I used Material UI üòÖ. I usually use Bootstrap on my projects.

## How about third-party frameworks?
I used Axios and Material UI's.

## Rate the project based on its difficulty from 1-10 (10 being extremely difficult)
It's probably around 5 or 6. I mean it's a pretty easy project. The only thing that complicates me (a bit) during production is its dynamic data from the API. 
There's also that CORS policy error. I can't call the API in a quick and consecutive manner since CORS will temporarily block my app. LOL. So if I'm making some changes here and there, I have to wait for a few seconds (or even minutes) to test the app again. Quite annoying, but very understandable.
